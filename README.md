# Hello! I'm John 

I'm a computer engineering student at the University of Michigan who builds systems and workflows using
algorithms, data, and real-world constraints.

I’m especially interested in:
- Product/service-driven engineering
- Turning data into tools

## What I'm building
- Rule-based fraud detection systems (C++)
- Environmental and geospatial analysis tools (MATLAB)
- Route optimization and planning algorithms (C++)
- Radiation tests and tumor detection systems (MATLAB)

## Featured Projects
- **Fraud Detection System** — interpretable NLP-style scoring pipeline in C++
- **Offshore Wind Site Analysis** — data-driven constraint evaluation + visualization
- **Radiation & Tumor Detection** — spatial analysis workflow highlighting high-risk zones
- **Route Planner** — nearest-neighbor optimization with corrupted data handling


## What I Use
C++ · MATLAB · Algorithms · Data Processing · Visualization 

Currently focused on building stronger engineering depth, product intuition, and creating a product to bring to market
