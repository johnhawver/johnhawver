# Hello — I'm John Hawver

I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Michigan focused on building reliable, data-driven systems that operate under real-world constraints.

My interests include:
- Algorithms and data structures  
- Spatial and route optimization systems  
- Signal and image processing  
- Software systems that integrate structured data pipelines with decision logic

## Selected Projects

### Route Optimization Engine (C++)
Greedy nearest-neighbor route planner that:
- Cleans and validates corrupted input datasets  
- Generates optimized delivery routes  
- Emphasizes modular design and robust file I/O handling  

Focus: algorithmic correctness, data integrity, and scalable system structure.

### Radiation & Tumor Detection Pipeline (MATLAB)
Signal and image processing workflow that:
- Processes radiation sensor data and MRI scans  
- Generates heatmaps and safety zone visualizations  
- Applies threshold-based classification for anomaly detection  

Focus: vectorized computation, layered visualization, and structured analysis.

---

### Offshore Wind Site Analysis (MATLAB)
Constraint-based geospatial evaluation tool that:
- Assesses environmental and siting constraints  
- Produces visualization outputs for decision support  
- Integrates structured environmental datasets  

Focus: spatial reasoning and layered data modeling.

---

### Fraud Detection System (C++)
Rule-based scoring pipeline using structured features and threshold logic to classify data patterns.

Focus: interpretable system design and modular engineering.
